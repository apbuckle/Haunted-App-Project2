Goal is to create an app that would be a one stop location for users to find Halloween venues in their area.  App lets users navigate through all the various venues and see what attrations they each have and scare cast that work there.  Allows further information about each venue and specific attrations plus the ability to add new venues and attractions and make edits to those events too.
